      Explanations is a critical thinking exercise about race and privilege <br><br>

      for them to understand with the responsibilities that they have to BlPOC and POC.<br>
      The idea for this exercise came at a time when race was being openly discussed in the media, the internet and social media.
      We wanted that conversation to continue and for people to learn and apply the lessons that they learnt.<br>
