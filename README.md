<h3>What does it do?</h3>
Explanations simulates a card game where players lay the cards face down and are able to choose a card to flip over and engage with the topic on it. Due to the nature of this project being educational, each card has resources attached to it that users can access by the information button on each card face as well as through the resource directory.
