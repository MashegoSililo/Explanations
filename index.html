          Explanations is an exercise that encourages critical thinking about race and racism through
          the use of cards as prompts to get people thinking and talking about these issues.
          <br><br>
          Keep in mind that issues regarding race are serious and should not simply be hypothesized about,
          as you go through the cards keep in mind that these issues affect real people and as a
          result your responses do have real world consequences.
          <br><br>
          Respond to each card as honestly as possible with a clear and complete answer.<br>
          Go through the decks as a group or feel free to do the exercise alone.<br><br>
          The exercise is split into 3 suites: <br>
        <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>The first suite runs through definitions that are often used in conversations and written
            pieces about race.</li>
          <li>The second suite attempts to ask difficult questions and have you think more critically about
            race and your behaviour regarding it.</li>
          <li>The third suite closes the exercise with questions on the work you can do moving onwards.</li>
        </ul>
        If you are unsure of a word or phrase or how to respond, you can simply look it up or refer to the resources
        page where you will find definitions and links to useful articles, posts, essays and books.
